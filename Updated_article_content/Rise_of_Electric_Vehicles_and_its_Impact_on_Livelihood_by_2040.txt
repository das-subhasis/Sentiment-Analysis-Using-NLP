In 2020 5th largest automobile market world . While fact good news automobile industry , bad news environment . How ? Well , 3rd largest oil-consuming Green House Gas ( GHG ) emitting nation . According Assessment Report ( AR6 ) Intergovernmental Panel Climate Change ( IPCC ) , 2020 lockdown , complete economy shut 36 50 big cities unhealthy air quality.Taking account current situation studies , vehicles annually contribute 290 Giga grams PM2 , time , 8 percent total GHG ( Green House Gas ) Emissions transport sector Delhi , exceeds 30 percent account promises made decreasing Carbon emissions NITI Ayog electrify ’ 2W segment 2025 3W segment 2030 . aimed create 100 percent Electric Vehicle ( EV ) 2030 . While experts goal ambitious hybrid Electric Vehicles ( EVs ) Internal Combustion Engines ( ICEs ) decade ushering goal faster fashion . And give reasons :  So basically , war never-ending exporter crude petroleum world , rates petroleum market skyrocketing 3rd largest oil-consuming nation 90 percent oil imported , lot ’ money driven controlled. Moreover , lockdown people stay distance people afford personal vehicles public . This largest market automobiles , population. The effect rising oil prices ( touching 100rs mark ) products , transportation costs increasing inflation . Therefore government hoping control import bills EVs ( Electric Vehicles ) Hydrogen Running Vehicles . But ( matter , ’ ) ’ catch hasty push increase country ’ import bill . How ? Well , EV components imported , worry , huge Indian Automobile Industries make EVs ( Electric Vehicles ) completely made , informed smart consumer . Now ’ government issue :  Since battery costs 70 percent total manufacturing cost EV ( Electrical Vehicle ) , MoRTH ( Ministry Road Transport Highways ) ‘ Battery service business model. The government allotted budget 100 crores latest budget. The government working applying Fame Policy spend 86 percent Consumer Incentives 10 percent Charging Infrastructure. The government attract FDIs import Li ( Lithium ) make batteries. The government promised build charging infrastructure . The government launched e-portal e-amrit.niti.gov COP26 Summit Glasgow . The portal insight major benefits EVs ( Electric Vehicles ) . The major benefits talked :  Zero Tailpipe Emission ( ZTE )  Lower Running Cost Lower Maintenance Less Tax Environmental Benefits Easy Drive QuiteYou feel government adamant “ ICE EV 2030 ” mission , ’ talk government add mission. The double Dividend Hypothesis David Pearce 1991 states environmentaltaxation improve economic environmental conditions recyclingrevenues obtained reduce pre-existing taxes. Norway toll free parking people EVs incentive. France give tax levitation people EVs.Now ’ chitchat bit problems consumers switch toEVs :  Short driving range EVs Long Battery Recharge Time Lack charging Infrastructure Higher cost Battery life High cost commercial electricity Poor roadsIf forward EV future build good road network isproven carbon emission ICE lesser good roads driving range EVs alsogreater good roads.Now ’ talk affect livelihood future 2040 . So give yousome expert ’ predictions conclude article :  According Crew Report demand power expected rise 80 percent. About 75 percent vehicles EVs. This usher Railways large distances. Let ’ forget air transport well. Transportation cost goods decrease Imports decrease large amounts. Empty petrol stations ( converted charging stations )  And writing reading self-solarized EVs.The obvious ( chuckles ) read , share small , additional important information summarized prediction . So , EV trade route Philippines , , US . And The Philippines extracts Ni ( Nickel ) batteries EVs Rio Tuba , mine , purifies The US makes batteries EVs . Now demand increasing , mining Rio Tuba increasing affecting Rainforests Philippines ecosystem , making question “ Is solution ? ” And predict :  High prices nonavailability batteries parts world .
